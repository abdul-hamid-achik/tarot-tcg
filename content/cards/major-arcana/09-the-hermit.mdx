# The Hermit

In solitude, The Hermit seeks truth, his lantern illuminating the path for those who follow.

*"The answers we seek are found in the silence within."*

The Hermit represents soul searching, introspection, and inner guidance. He rewards controlling fewer units with powerful card advantage.
