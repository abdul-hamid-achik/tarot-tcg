# Ace of Pentacles

*"In every seed lies the promise of a golden harvest."*

## Upright Meaning
New financial opportunities, material manifestation, prosperity, and practical beginnings. The Ace of Pentacles represents the foundation of material success - the first investment, job opportunity, or practical step toward abundance.

**Gameplay**: *New Prosperity* provides immediate mana acceleration plus a persistent mana source, representing how initial investments create ongoing prosperity.

## Reversed Meaning
Missed opportunities, poor financial planning, and lack of follow-through. The reversed Ace suggests opportunities that aren't seized or material goals pursued without proper foundation.

**Gameplay**: *Missed Opportunity* offers a chance to bypass normal costs and timing, representing luck or desperation that circumvents traditional planning.

## Symbolism & Lore
A hand emerges from clouds offering a golden pentacle above a lush garden path. The pentacle gleams with earthly promise, while the garden represents the material world ready to provide abundance to those who work with natural laws.

The path leads toward mountains, showing that material success requires both opportunity and persistent effort.

## Strategic Notes
- **Ramp Effect**: Upright form accelerates mana development significantly
- **Cheating Costs**: Reversed form can bypass mana requirements for powerful plays
- **Taurus Synergy**: Enhanced material benefits during Taurus season
- **Economic Engine**: Essential for strategies that require mana acceleration
- **Flexible Value**: Both forms provide different types of advantage
