# King of Pentacles

*"True wealth is not hoarded but shared, creating abundance for all."*

## Upright Meaning
Financial mastery, generosity, material success, and wise leadership. The King of Pentacles represents someone who has achieved material mastery and uses their wealth responsibly to benefit others and create lasting prosperity.

**Gameplay**: *Midas Touch* rewards established board presence with massive mana generation and scaling bonuses, representing how successful leadership creates prosperity for all.

## Reversed Meaning
Greed, corruption, and abuse of material power. The reversed King represents someone who hoards wealth, exploits others, and uses material success for selfish ends rather than community benefit.

**Gameplay**: *Greedy Hoarder* steals others' resources while making everything more expensive for opponents, representing economic manipulation and monopolistic behavior.

## Symbolism & Lore
The King sits on a throne decorated with bull heads (Taurus) and grape vines (abundance), wearing robes embroidered with golden pentacles. His castle in the background represents lasting material achievement, while the fertile landscape shows prosperity that benefits the entire kingdom.

He holds both a scepter (authority) and a pentacle (material wisdom), representing balanced leadership that combines power with practical understanding.

## Strategic Notes
- **Late Game Power**: High cost but potentially game-changing effects
- **Board Synergy**: Upright form rewards wide board development
- **Economic Warfare**: Reversed form disrupts opponent economies
- **Capricorn Synergy**: Enhanced scaling during Capricorn season
- **Win Condition**: Both forms can single-handedly shift game momentum
