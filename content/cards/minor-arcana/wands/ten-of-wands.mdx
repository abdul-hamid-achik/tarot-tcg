# Ten of Wands

*"Success is a burden only the strong can bear - but even mountains need rest."*

## Upright Meaning
Burden of success, responsibility, and being overburdened. The Ten of Wands represents the weight of achievement - having taken on too much responsibility or reaching the point where success itself becomes a burden requiring sacrifice.

**Gameplay**: *Heavy Burden* converts your entire hand into damage but leaves you temporarily resource-starved, perfectly representing the card's theme of sacrificing everything for immediate results.

## Reversed Meaning
Delegation, releasing burdens, and learning to share responsibility. The reversed Ten suggests learning to distribute weight and responsibility rather than carrying everything alone.

**Gameplay**: *Delegation* spreads the burden to opponents while gaining resources, representing the wisdom of sharing responsibility and leveraging others' efforts.

## Symbolism & Lore
A figure struggles to carry ten wands toward a distant village, bent under their weight but determined to complete the journey. The destination is visible but still requires effort - representing success that comes with sacrifice and the final push needed to achieve goals.

The completion of the Wands suit's numerical journey from Ace (spark) to Ten (burden of manifestation).

## Strategic Notes
- **Hand Conversion**: Upright form turns cards into immediate damage
- **Resource Disruption**: Reversed form affects all opponents while gaining advantage  
- **Sagittarius Synergy**: Enhanced effectiveness during Sagittarius season
- **Mid-Game Power**: Cost and effect balanced for significant board impact
- **Risk/Reward**: Both forms offer powerful effects with strategic costs
