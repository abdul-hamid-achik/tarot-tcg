# Ace of Cups

*"From the divine chalice flows infinite love, the source of all healing."*

## Upright Meaning
New emotional beginnings, love, intuition, and spiritual fulfillment. The Ace of Cups represents the pure essence of water energy - emotional openness, compassion, and the beginning of spiritual or romantic relationships.

**Gameplay**: *Overflowing Grace* provides healing that becomes permanent enhancement when applied to healthy targets, representing how love and care build lasting strength.

## Reversed Meaning
Emotional emptiness, blocked feelings, and withdrawal from others. The reversed Ace suggests emotional depletion, inability to connect with others, or using emotional manipulation.

**Gameplay**: *Emotional Void* drains others' resources and converts their loss into your gain, representing emotional vampirism and manipulation.

## Symbolism & Lore
A hand emerges from clouds offering a golden chalice overflowing with water. Five streams pour into a lotus-filled pond below, representing the five senses being overwhelmed by divine love. A dove descends carrying a communion wafer, symbolizing spiritual nourishment.

This represents the pure emotional and spiritual potential available to all beings when they open their hearts to divine love.

## Strategic Notes
- **Flexible Healing**: Upright form works on damaged units or enhances healthy ones
- **Resource Disruption**: Reversed form punishes opponents with small hands
- **Cancer Synergy**: Enhanced protective effects during Cancer season
- **Early Game Utility**: Low cost makes it useful throughout the game
- **Cups Foundation**: Core card for Water/emotion-based strategies
