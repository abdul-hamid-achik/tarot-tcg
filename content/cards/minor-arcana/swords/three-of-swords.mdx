# Three of Swords

*"Sometimes the heart must break before it can truly understand love."*

## Upright Meaning
Heartbreak, sorrow, painful separation, and emotional trauma. The Three of Swords represents the inevitable pain that comes with love and attachment - betrayal, loss, and the sorrow that teaches us about the true value of what we've lost.

**Gameplay**: *Heartbreak* forces difficult sacrifices on opponents but costs you health, representing how causing pain to others often hurts ourselves as well.

## Reversed Meaning
Healing from heartbreak, forgiveness, and moving forward. The reversed Three suggests recovery from emotional trauma, learning from pain, and finding the strength to love again.

**Gameplay**: *Healing from Pain* transforms destruction into mutual benefit - removing threats while providing compensation and personal healing, representing growth through adversity.

## Symbolism & Lore
A red heart pierced by three swords against a stormy sky, with rain falling like tears. The heart represents pure emotion wounded by the swords of conflict, betrayal, and loss. Yet the heart remains whole despite the wounds - showing that love endures even through pain.

The storm suggests that this pain is temporary, though intense, and will eventually pass.

## Strategic Notes
- **Costly Removal**: Upright form removes threats but at personal cost
- **Mutual Benefit**: Reversed form turns removal into advantage for both players
- **Libra Synergy**: Enhanced balance effects during Libra season
- **Strategic Sacrifice**: Both forms require careful consideration of costs vs benefits
- **Emotional Strategy**: Fits themes of sacrifice and recovery in control decks
