# Tarot TCG Meta Guide

*Where mystical wisdom meets strategic gameplay*

## Game Philosophy

The Tarot TCG creates a unique fusion of traditional tarot symbolism with modern trading card game mechanics. Every card represents authentic tarot meanings while providing engaging gameplay that rewards both strategic thinking and intuitive understanding.

## Core Mechanics

### Upright vs Reversed Orientations
Every card can appear in **upright** or **reversed** orientation, fundamentally changing its effect:

- **Upright**: Represents the positive, balanced expression of the card's energy
- **Reversed**: Represents the shadow, blocked, or excessive expression of the same energy
- **Random Orientation**: Cards are drawn with random orientation, adding unpredictability
- **Strategic Depth**: Players must plan around both possible effects of each card

### Zodiac Class System
Cards belong to zodiac classes that provide **seasonal buffs**:

- **12 Zodiac Signs**: Each active during their astrological season
- **Temporary Buffs**: Only active during corresponding time periods
- **Strategic Timing**: Players can time their plays around zodiac seasons
- **Authentic Astrology**: Based on real astrological correspondences

### Elemental Harmony
The four elements provide thematic cohesion:

- **Fire (Wands)**: Aggression, inspiration, direct damage
- **Water (Cups)**: Healing, emotions, transformation
- **Air (Swords)**: Control, intellect, card manipulation
- **Earth (Pentacles)**: Resources, permanence, material advantage

## Major Arcana Strategy

The 22 Major Arcana cards represent **powerful, game-changing effects** with deep symbolic meaning:

### The Fool's Journey
Cards follow the traditional Fool's Journey through spiritual development:

- **0-7**: Material world mastery (The Fool → The Chariot)
- **8-14**: Spiritual trials and transformation (Strength → Temperance)
- **15-21**: Transcendence and completion (The Devil → The World)
