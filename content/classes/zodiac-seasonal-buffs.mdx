# Zodiac Seasonal Class Buffs

Zodiac signs are **not cards themselves** but rather **class buffs** that enhance tarot cards during specific seasonal periods. Each zodiac sign is active during its traditional astrological timeframe, providing temporary bonuses to matching cards.

## How Zodiac Buffs Work

- **Seasonal Activation**: Each zodiac buff is only active during its corresponding astrological period
- **Class Matching**: Tarot cards can have zodiac class assignments that benefit from active zodiac buffs
- **Temporary Effects**: Buffs are automatically applied/removed based on current date/season
- **Strategic Timing**: Players can time their plays around zodiac seasons for maximum effect

- **Ranked Play**: Climbing during your zodiac season provides natural advantages

### Lore Integration
The zodiac classes represent the cosmic forces that influence the tarot archetypes. While the Major and Minor Arcana cards embody eternal spiritual truths, the zodiac provides the temporal, earthly energy that gives them form and power in our material realm.
