## üéØ Game Mechanics

The game implements a sophisticated turn-based combat system with unique tarot-themed mechanics:

### Turn Structure
1. **Mulligan Phase** - Both players can redraw unwanted cards once
2. **Round Start** - Refill mana, draw a card, reset attack tokens
3. **Action Phase** - Play cards, activate abilities, declare attacks
4. **Combat Resolution** - Resolve all attacks and damage
5. **End Round** - Unused mana converts to spell mana (max 3)

### Combat System
- **Direct Attack** - Hearthstone-style: units can attack enemy units or the player's health directly
- **Attack Tokens** - Players alternate who has attack initiative each round
- **Summoning Sickness** - Units cannot attack the turn they're played
- **Combat Math** - Simultaneous damage resolution for unit-vs-unit combat

### Tarot Mechanics
- **Card Orientation** - Each card drawn has a 50% chance to be reversed
- **Upright Effects** - Standard card text and abilities
- **Reversed Effects** - Alternate abilities, often with a twist or downside
- **Zodiac Buffs** - Cards gain +1/+1 when played during their zodiac season

### Win Conditions
- **Health Depletion** - Reduce opponent's health to 0 (default)
- **Deck Out** - Opponent cannot draw when deck is empty
- **Alternative Conditions** - Special win conditions based on game mode (zodiac dominance, arcana mastery, etc.)

## üß™ Testing

The project uses **Vitest** with comprehensive test coverage across services, hooks, and components.

### Running Tests

```bash
npm run test              # Run all tests once
npm run test:watch        # Watch mode for development
npm run test:ui           # Interactive Vitest UI
npm run test:coverage     # Generate coverage report
```

### Test Coverage

- **Integration Tests** (`src/__tests__/`) - Full game flow scenarios
- **Service Tests** (`src/services/__tests__/`) - Game logic and combat
- **Hook Tests** (`src/hooks/__tests__/`) - Custom React hooks
- **Component Tests** (`src/components/__tests__/`) - UI interactions

Coverage goals: >80% for services, >60% for components.

## ü§ù Contributing

This project follows standard React/TypeScript patterns with **service-based architecture** for game logic separation:

- **Services** handle core game logic (combat, effects, AI)
- **Hooks** provide React integration layer
- **Zustand store** manages global game state
- **Pure functions** for predictable state updates

We prioritize comprehensive testing and clean architecture. Check `CLAUDE.md` for detailed development guidelines.
