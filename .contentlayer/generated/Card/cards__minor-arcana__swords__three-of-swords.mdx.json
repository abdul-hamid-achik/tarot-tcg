    "raw": "\n# Three of Swords\n\n*\"Sometimes the heart must break before it can truly understand love.\"*\n\n## Upright Meaning\nHeartbreak, sorrow, painful separation, and emotional trauma. The Three of Swords represents the inevitable pain that comes with love and attachment - betrayal, loss, and the sorrow that teaches us about the true value of what we've lost.\n\n**Gameplay**: *Heartbreak* forces difficult sacrifices on opponents but costs you health, representing how causing pain to others often hurts ourselves as well.\n\n## Reversed Meaning\nHealing from heartbreak, forgiveness, and moving forward. The reversed Three suggests recovery from emotional trauma, learning from pain, and finding the strength to love again.\n\n**Gameplay**: *Healing from Pain* transforms destruction into mutual benefit - removing threats while providing compensation and personal healing, representing growth through adversity.\n\n## Symbolism & Lore\nA red heart pierced by three swords against a stormy sky, with rain falling like tears. The heart represents pure emotion wounded by the swords of conflict, betrayal, and loss. Yet the heart remains whole despite the wounds - showing that love endures even through pain.\n\nThe storm suggests that this pain is temporary, though intense, and will eventually pass.\n\n## Strategic Notes\n- **Costly Removal**: Upright form removes threats but at personal cost\n- **Mutual Benefit**: Reversed form turns removal into advantage for both players\n- **Libra Synergy**: Enhanced balance effects during Libra season\n- **Strategic Sacrifice**: Both forms require careful consideration of costs vs benefits\n- **Emotional Strategy**: Fits themes of sacrifice and recovery in control decks",
