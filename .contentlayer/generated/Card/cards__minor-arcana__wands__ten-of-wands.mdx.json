    "raw": "\n# Ten of Wands\n\n*\"Success is a burden only the strong can bear - but even mountains need rest.\"*\n\n## Upright Meaning\nBurden of success, responsibility, and being overburdened. The Ten of Wands represents the weight of achievement - having taken on too much responsibility or reaching the point where success itself becomes a burden requiring sacrifice.\n\n**Gameplay**: *Heavy Burden* converts your entire hand into damage but leaves you temporarily resource-starved, perfectly representing the card's theme of sacrificing everything for immediate results.\n\n## Reversed Meaning\nDelegation, releasing burdens, and learning to share responsibility. The reversed Ten suggests learning to distribute weight and responsibility rather than carrying everything alone.\n\n**Gameplay**: *Delegation* spreads the burden to opponents while gaining resources, representing the wisdom of sharing responsibility and leveraging others' efforts.\n\n## Symbolism & Lore\nA figure struggles to carry ten wands toward a distant village, bent under their weight but determined to complete the journey. The destination is visible but still requires effort - representing success that comes with sacrifice and the final push needed to achieve goals.\n\nThe completion of the Wands suit's numerical journey from Ace (spark) to Ten (burden of manifestation).\n\n## Strategic Notes\n- **Hand Conversion**: Upright form turns cards into immediate damage\n- **Resource Disruption**: Reversed form affects all opponents while gaining advantage  \n- **Sagittarius Synergy**: Enhanced effectiveness during Sagittarius season\n- **Mid-Game Power**: Cost and effect balanced for significant board impact\n- **Risk/Reward**: Both forms offer powerful effects with strategic costs",
