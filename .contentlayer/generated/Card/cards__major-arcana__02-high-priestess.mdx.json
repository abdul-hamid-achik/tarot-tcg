The High Priestess represents the feminine principle of receptive wisdom, psychic abilities, and access to hidden knowledge through spiritual intuition rather than logical analysis.\n\n**Gameplay**: *Intuitive Knowledge* provides consistent card selection and board strengthening, representing the High Priestess's role as guardian of hidden wisdom and nurturer of growth.\n\n## Reversed Meaning\nHidden agendas, disconnection from intuition, and secrets revealed. When reversed, the High Priestess represents blocked intuition, manipulation through hidden information, or the inappropriate revelation of secrets.\n\n**Gameplay**: *Hidden Secrets* exposes and disrupts opponents' plans, forcing difficult choices and representing the shadow side of hidden knowledge being used against others.\n\n## Symbolism & Lore\nThe High Priestess sits between two pillars (Boaz and Jachin) representing duality and balance. Behind her hangs a veil decorated with pomegranates (feminine fertility and wisdom). At her feet flows the unconscious water, while the crescent moon crown represents her connection to lunar cycles and intuition.\n\nThe scroll of Torah in her lap contains divine law and hidden wisdom accessible only through spiritual development.\n\n## Strategic Notes\n- **Card Advantage**: Upright form provides consistent card selection and deck filtering\n- **Information Control**: Reversed form disrupts opponent's plans through hand disruption\n- **Cancer Synergy**: Enhanced protective abilities during Cancer season\n- **Defensive Value**: High health makes her difficult to remove\n- **Support Role**: Upright form strengthens your entire board presence",
