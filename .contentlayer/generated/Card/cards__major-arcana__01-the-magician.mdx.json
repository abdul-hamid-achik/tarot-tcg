The Magician represents the ability to channel universal energy to manifest desires into reality. He has all the tools needed (the four suits) and the knowledge to use them effectively.\n\n**Gameplay**: *As Above, So Below* embodies the Magician's ability to bridge the spiritual and material realms, recursively accessing magical knowledge (spells) with enhanced efficiency.\n\n## Reversed Meaning\nManipulation, poor planning, untapped talents, and lack of focus. The reversed Magician uses their abilities for selfish gain, deception, and control over others rather than genuine manifestation.\n\n**Gameplay**: *Manipulation* represents the dark side of magical power - forcing opponents' choices and stealing control, showing magic used for domination rather than creation.\n\n## Symbolism & Lore\nThe Magician points one hand toward heaven and one toward earth, channeling divine energy into the material world. On his table lie the four tools representing the Minor Arcana suits: the wand (fire/wands), cup (water/cups), sword (air/swords), and pentacle (earth/pentacles). The infinity symbol (∞) above his head represents unlimited potential.\n\nThe red roses and white lilies in his garden symbolize passion and purity united in perfect balance.\n\n## Strategic Notes\n- **Spell Recursion**: Upright form provides powerful late-game value by reusing key spells\n- **Tempo Swing**: Reversed form can steal games through discard and theft effects  \n- **Gemini Synergy**: Benefits from duality and copying effects during Gemini season\n- **Versatile Target**: Strong in both aggressive and control strategies\n- **Resource Management**: Both forms affect card economy in different ways",
