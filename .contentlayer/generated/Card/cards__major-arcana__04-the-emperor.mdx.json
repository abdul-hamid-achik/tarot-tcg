    "raw": "\n# The Emperor - IV\n\n*\"Through order and discipline, chaos becomes creation, and weakness becomes strength.\"*\n\n## Upright Meaning\nAuthority, structure, leadership, and paternal protection. The Emperor represents masculine principle of active leadership, logical thinking, and the establishment of order through strength and wisdom. He is the benevolent ruler who protects through structure.\n\n**Gameplay**: *Imperial Authority* embodies positive leadership - strengthening allies and leading coordinated attacks, representing the Emperor's role as protector and military strategist.\n\n## Reversed Meaning\nTyranny, abuse of power, and rigid control. The reversed Emperor represents authoritarian leadership, inflexibility, and the use of power for selfish ends rather than protection of others.\n\n**Gameplay**: *Tyrannical Rule* shows corrupted authority - stealing others' forces and imposing punitive taxes, representing power used for domination rather than protection.\n\n## Symbolism & Lore\nThe Emperor sits on a throne carved from solid rock, representing unchanging stability and unshakeable authority. He holds an ankh scepter (life and power) and an orb (worldly dominion). The ram heads on his throne connect him to Aries energy - pioneering leadership and masculine strength.\n\nBehind him rise barren mountains, showing that his authority extends even to the harshest environments through discipline and order.\n\n## Strategic Notes\n- **Board Dominance**: Upright form creates powerful board-wide effects and coordinated attacks\n- **Control Elements**: Reversed form provides both theft and taxation mechanics\n- **Aries Synergy**: Enhanced aggressive capabilities during Aries season\n- **High Health**: Difficult to remove, providing lasting board impact\n- **Army Building**: Both forms work well with wide token strategies",
